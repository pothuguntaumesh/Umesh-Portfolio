                  While applying for jobs, I kept losing track of where and when
                  I’d applied, missing follow-ups and letting opportunities slip
                  through. I built Growly to solve this,an AI-powered platform
                  that connects to Gmail, identifies job-related emails, and
                  organizes them into a live dashboard with status tracking. The
                  system uses LLMs to filter and classify applications, helping
                  users stay on top of deadlines and priorities. In its first
                  week, it attracted 200+ beta users and earned AWS & Azure
                  startup credits, validating both the need and the approach.

                  collaborated with PhD students, professors, and researchers on
                  Analogy Connector, a platform designed to help people in
                  different domains who are working on analogous research find
                  each other. We used LLMs to analyze and connect research
                  papers across disciplines, surfacing unexpected parallels and
                  related concepts. The aim was to break down academic silos,
                  enabling researchers to discover collaborators and inspiration
                  from fields they might not otherwise explore, ultimately
                  accelerating innovation.

                  As a Graduate Assistant at UMD on a Google-funded project, I
                  was tasked with creating a tool to help students with
                  programming assignments without simply giving them the
                  answers. I developed CodeGenBot, a Discord-based assistant
                  that uses prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation
                  (RAG), and policy guardrails to provide hints, explain
                  concepts, and guide students toward solutions while
                  maintaining academic integrity. It integrates course materials
                  via a vector search backend, retrieves relevant snippets, and
                  combines them with structured prompts to generate targeted
                  guidance. It now supports over 1,000 students, fostering real
                  learning rather than copy-paste dependency.

                  Telora was born out of a hackathon challenge to build
                  something meaningful using voice AI agents. I decided to focus
                  on post-purchase customer feedback, a step that many merchants
                  overlook but that’s critical for improving products and
                  retaining customers. I built an AI-powered voice agent that
                  integrates directly with Shopify, automatically calling
                  customers after their online or offline purchases. The agent
                  collects spoken feedback and reviews in natural conversations,
                  then processes and organizes them into a clean dashboard.
                  Merchants can instantly see sentiment, highlights, and
                  actionable points without digging through raw recordings,
                  making it easy to turn customer voices into improvements and
                  public reviews.

                  When I began applying for jobs, I quickly realized that in
                  today’s competitive market, timing is critical, the earlier
                  you apply, the higher your chances of being noticed before the
                  role gets saturated with applicants. To give myself an edge, I
                  built Early Apply, an internal job board that scrapes postings
                  directly from multiple ATS platforms for the specific
                  companies and roles I’m targeting. The system checks every 15
                  minutes and instantly emails me when a match is found,
                  ensuring I can apply within minutes of a job going live.

          I started building to solve my own problems, from tracking job
          applications to helping students learn better.
          <br />
          <br />

          projects that others asked to use too. I care about shipping fast,

              I got my start in college. My first programming course humbled me; I earned a C. Instead of treating that as a ceiling, I treated it as a starting point. I taught myself after class, built small tools to save time, and kept moving from tiny scripts to simple web apps that actually helped me day to day.
              <br>
              <br>  
              In my final year I joined a small startup and learned what it means to build for real people on real timelines. That experience pushed me to keep going. I came to the US for grad school and kept turning personal problems into products: a job-application tracker when my search got messy, a learning assistant that guides students instead of giving answers, a voice-based feedback tool for merchants, and a project that helps researchers in different fields find each other.
              <br>
              <br>
              My approach is straightforward. Notice a problem that matters, talk to the people who feel it, ship a minimal version, then improve it until it earns its place. That’s how I started, and it’s how I still work.

              To build tools that make people's lives genuinely easier, not just
              add to the noise. I want to create software that people actually
              use, not because they have to, but because it solves a real
              problem they didn't know they could fix. Every project should
              start with "this bothers me" and end with "this helps others."

              I’m driven by the gap between "how things are" and "how they could be." I look for friction, turn it into a clear problem statement, and build the simplest thing that measurably improves it. I care about usefulness, reliability, and respect for users, with privacy by default, clarity over flash, and outcomes over demos. My bias is to ship, learn from real usage, and iterate quickly while raising the quality bar each cycle. I’m motivated by work that compounds, by tools that save time, deepen understanding, and quietly make the everyday better.

                  Built Nesh as a Chrome extension to revolutionize how we interact with text on the web using LLMs. Simply typing /nesh in any text field invokes AI assistance, while right-clicking provides options to rewrite, improve, or generate content. The vision is to make it context-aware – able to see what you see and instantly guide you in doing things or fixing whatever you need on websites just by prompting it. Currently working to open source this project so everyone can use and help develop it, making AI assistance truly ubiquitous across the web.

                  Built this Kanban board as part of my journey through Frontend Mentor challenges, where I solved most of the available challenges to master Frontend Development. This was during my early learning phase when I was focused on understanding modern frontend development patterns. The project features a complete task management system with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, multiple board states, and a clean, responsive design. It represents a milestone in my frontend development skills and my commitment to learning through practical, hands-on projects.

                  This holds a special place as my very first project, built almost 5 years ago when I was learning Python from YouTube tutorials. I had just discovered backtracking algorithms and was inspired by someone's Sudoku solver video, but I wanted to create something original that wasn't already out there. The Knights Tour problem fascinated me – the challenge of moving a knight across a chessboard visiting every square exactly once. I built a real-time visualizer using Python's Turtle module that shows the knight's movements as it explores the board, backtracking when it hits dead ends. It was my first taste of bringing algorithms to life visually.
