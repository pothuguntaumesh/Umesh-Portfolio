    <!-- I like building tools that make life easier. Sometimes they scale. Sometimes
    they crash. I learn either way.I build with purpose. Every project starts
    with a problem that bothers me enough to fix, for myself first, then for
    everyone else. -->

    <bold>Full-Stack & AI Engineer.</bold> I turn concrete problems into
    production-ready products, shipping in small, test-backed iterations with
    metrics, tracing, and clear APIs. I start from real user pain, ship a
    minimal version, and iterate until itâ€™s fast, reliable, and useful.
