            Built Nesh as a Chrome extension to revolutionize how we interact
            with text on the web using LLMs. Simply typing /nesh in any text
            field invokes AI assistance, while right-clicking provides options
            to rewrite, improve, or generate content. The vision is to make it
            context-aware – able to see what you see and instantly guide you in
            doing things or fixing whatever you need on websites just by
            prompting it. Currently working to open source this project so
            everyone can use and help develop it, making AI assistance truly
            ubiquitous across the web.

            Created ClearHold for a friend who needed a solution to check
            compliance for social media posts. This tool is specifically
            designed for Independent Financial Advisors and Independent
            Insurance Agents to verify that their content adheres to regulatory
            compliance requirements. The platform analyzes social media posts
            and flags potential compliance issues before they're published,
            helping professionals maintain their licenses while engaging
            effectively with clients on social platforms.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Note:</strong> This project was never fully completed. After
            building the basic functionality, my friend didn't see the potential
            for it to scale, so development was discontinued. Only the core
            compliance checking features were implemented.

            Built this Kanban board as part of my journey through
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges"
              >Frontend Mentor challenges</a
            >, where I solved most of the available challenges to master
            Frontend Development. This was during my early learning phase when I
            was focused on understanding modern frontend development patterns.
            The project features a complete task management system with
            intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, multiple board states, and a
            clean, responsive design. It represents a milestone in my frontend
            development skills and my commitment to learning through practical,
            hands-on projects.

            This holds a special place as my very first project, built almost 5
            years ago when I was learning Python from YouTube tutorials. I had
            just discovered backtracking algorithms and was inspired by
            someone's Sudoku solver video, but I wanted to create something
            original that wasn't already out there. The Knights Tour problem
            fascinated me – the challenge of moving a knight across a chessboard
            visiting every square exactly once. I built a real-time visualizer
            using Python's Turtle module that shows the knight's movements as it
            explores the board, backtracking when it hits dead ends. It was my
            first taste of bringing algorithms to life visually.

<!-- Nesh
ClearHold
kanban board
knights tour visualizer.

Nesh is a chrome extension, which helps us in writing anything usiing LLMs. This can be invoked in any text field, on chrome,  just entering /nesh will help us prompt /nesh to write anything. and right clicking will give options to rewrite etc. I want to make it in such a way that it can see what you see and instantly help you guide doing things, or fixing whatever you want on websites just by prompting it.  I want to open source this project so that everyone can use this and help me develop it. (WIP)

ClearHold is something I built for a friend, who wants to check compliance for social media posts. This is helpful for Independent financial advisors, Independent Insurance agents to check if their conent adhers to compliance or not. (WIP)

Kanban Board is something I built a long time ago, this was a part of frontend mentor challenges( I almost solved most of them) to learn CSS and React a long time ago. I built an entire app using react.

Knights tour visulazier, this is a special one, which was my first project, which I built almost 5 years ago, I learnt python from youtube. I wanted to build something on my own, I was recently learning backtracking algos back then. I saw someone build a suduko solver on youtube, I wanted to create something which wasn't present till then. I went ahead and built a knights tour visualizer, which shows the knights movements in real-time using Turtle module.
