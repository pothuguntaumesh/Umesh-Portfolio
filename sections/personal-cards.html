        I got my start in college. My first programming course humbled me; I
        earned a C. Instead of treating that as a ceiling, I treated it as a
        starting point. I taught myself after class, built small tools to save
        time, and kept moving from tiny scripts to simple web apps that actually
        helped me day to day.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my final year I joined a small startup and learned what it means to
        build for real people on real timelines. That experience pushed me to
        keep going. I came to the US for grad school and kept turning personal
        problems into products: a job-application tracker when my search got
        messy, a learning assistant that guides students instead of giving
        answers, a voice-based feedback tool for merchants, and a project that
        helps researchers in different fields find each other.
        <br />
        <br />
        My approach is straightforward. Notice a problem that matters, talk to
        the people who feel it, ship a minimal version, then improve it until it
        earns its place. That's how I started, and it's how I still work.

        To build tools that make people's lives genuinely easier, not just add
        to the noise. I want to create software that people actually use, not
        because they have to, but because it solves a real problem they didn't
        know they could fix. Every project should start with "this bothers me"
        and end with "this helps others."

        I'm driven by the gap between "how things are" and "how they could be."
        I look for friction, turn it into a clear problem statement, and build
        the simplest thing that measurably improves it. I care about usefulness,
        reliability, and respect for users, with privacy by default, clarity
        over flash, and outcomes over demos. My bias is to ship, learn from real
        usage, and iterate quickly while raising the quality bar each cycle. I'm
        motivated by work that compounds, by tools that save time, deepen
        understanding, and quietly make the everyday better.
