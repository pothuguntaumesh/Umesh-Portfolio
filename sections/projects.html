            While applying for jobs, I kept losing track of where and when I'd
            applied, missing follow-ups and letting opportunities slip through.
            I built Growly to solve this, an AI-powered platform that connects
            to Gmail, identifies job-related emails, and organizes them into a
            live dashboard with status tracking. The system uses LLMs to filter
            and classify applications, helping users stay on top of deadlines
            and priorities. In its first week, it attracted 200+ beta users and
            earned AWS & Azure startup credits, validating both the need and the
            approach.

            During my time as a GenAI Research Engineer at UMD, I collaborated
            with PhD students, professors, and researchers on Analogy Connector,
            a platform designed to help people in different domains who are
            working on analogous research find each other. We used LLMs to
            analyze and connect research papers across disciplines, surfacing
            unexpected parallels and related concepts. The aim was to break down
            academic silos, enabling researchers to discover collaborators and
            inspiration from fields they might not otherwise explore, ultimately
            accelerating innovation.

            As a Graduate Assistant at UMD on a Google-funded project, I was
            tasked with creating a tool to help students with programming
            assignments without simply giving them the answers. I developed
            CodeGenBot, a Discord-based assistant that uses prompt engineering,
            retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and policy guardrails to
            provide hints, explain concepts, and guide students toward solutions
            while maintaining academic integrity. It integrates course materials
            via a vector search backend, retrieves relevant snippets, and
            combines them with structured prompts to generate targeted guidance.
            It now supports over 1,000 students, fostering real learning rather
            than copy-paste dependency.

            Telora was born out of a hackathon challenge to build something
            meaningful using voice AI agents. I decided to focus on
            post-purchase customer feedback, a step that many merchants overlook
            but that's critical for improving products and retaining customers.
            I built an AI-powered voice agent that integrates directly with
            Shopify, automatically calling customers after their online or
            offline purchases. The agent collects spoken feedback and reviews in
            natural conversations, then processes and organizes them into a
            clean dashboard. Merchants can instantly see sentiment, highlights,
            and actionable points without digging through raw recordings, making
            it easy to turn customer voices into improvements and public
            reviews.

            When I began applying for jobs, I quickly realized that in today's
            competitive market, timing is critical, the earlier you apply, the
            higher your chances of being noticed before the role gets saturated
            with applicants. To give myself an edge, I built Early Apply, an
            internal job board that scrapes postings directly from multiple ATS
            platforms for the specific companies and roles I'm targeting. The
            system checks every 15 minutes and instantly emails me when a match
            is found, ensuring I can apply within minutes of a job going live.
